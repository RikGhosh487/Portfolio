This program is a Random Forest Regressor that takes 4 color indices from SDSS of stellar objects and regresses to a stellar metallicity value. Metallicity requires spectroscopic data, which is not as abundant as photometric data. Therefore, this program allows the computation of metallicity of stars that lack spectroscopic data.
